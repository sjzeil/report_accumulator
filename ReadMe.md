# Report Accumulator

## Summary

Monitor a variety of unit testing and static analysis reports and
accumulate statistics that can be plotted to portray development
trends.

This package will support interaction between a report directory (as
commonly constructed in Gradle Java projects) and a project
website to which those reports are regularly copied. The program
maintains accumulated statistics (e.g., tests passed and failed, test
coverage, number of warning messages issued) is simple .csv files on
the course website.

## Project Status

Version 1.4

[Reports](http://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/gitlab/reportAccumulator/reports/)

## Usage


In settings.gradle:

    pluginManagement {
        repositories {
            ivy { // Use my own CS dept repo
                url 'https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/ivyrepo'
            }
            gradlePluginPortal()
            mavenCentral()
        }
    }


In build.gradle:

    plugins {
        id 'java'
        id 'pmd' // and/or checkstyle, jacoco, spotbugs
        id 'edu.odu.cs.report_accumulator' version '1.4' 
    }

    reportStats {
	    reportsURL = 'https://project/reports/url/'
	    htmlSourceDir = file('src/main/html')  // default value
        reportsDir = file('build/reports') // default value
        buildID = "12345"                  // defaults to current date, but can be any run identifier
    }
    
    
The plugin adds a `reportStats` task, which will examine the `reportsDir` directory for
reports generated by JUnit, Jacoco, PMD, FindBugs, SpotBugs, & Checkstyle.
If found, it extracts one or more point statistics (e.g., # of failures) from
the report. It then checks to see if the website at the `reportsURL` has CSV
files from prior runs of this task. If so, it downloads the current CSV file
and appends the new point statistics to it. If not, it creates a new CSV file
to hold the statistics.  It also copies all files from `htmlSourceDir` into the
`reportsDir`.

The intention is that these CSV files will be uploaded together with the other
files in `reportsDir` to update the project website.
